# Dynamo to CL via AWS CLI

Common Lisp - Access Dynamo via the AWS CLI

There are some existing solutions to get to Dynamo from CL but none of them worked with the security setup I needed.  
AWS4-Sign was promising but I still had challenges setting it up. This is the best I could came up with, and it is for quick REPL usage and to practice Common Lisp.  

Doesn't hurt to share it with the world at large, though.
